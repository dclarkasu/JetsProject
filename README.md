# Jets Project

## Description
This project is a fleet of Jet objects. The objective was to create a menu where the user was able to manipulate a fleet of jet aircraft. A user can view each jet's statistics, the fastest one, jet with the longest range, add a new jet to the fleet, view all the pilots' information, or quit the program. 

## Topics Covered

* Object-oriented design
* Methods
* Inheritance
* Arrays
* UML
* TDD
* JUnit

## Process and Things Learned
In order to begin this project there was a lot of discussion and planning to decide which classes were needed and how the general flow of operations would go. There is a test class for running JUnit tests and a class with a main method to run the program. The supporting classes create jet and pilot objects as well as house those object arrays in a hangar or barracks depending on what it is. 

This was a difficult project but one I felt much more competent in versus the week before. I was able to add a personal touch and exceed the minimun goals a little which is a good feeling. Combing logic with syntax and what I am able to right is still coming along slowly, but it is getting better.
